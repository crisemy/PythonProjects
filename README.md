# Python Automation Framework (PAF)

The intent of this Repository is just to Learn and start creating a Brand New Python Automation Framework with Python. A cool one actually. 
That's it! 

# Set Up
## Python Version
By the time this Framework was created, I started it by using the **Python 3.7** Version. However, you might user any 3.x version you'd prefer. I do recomment not to use 2.x versions though.

### Installing Python
As I mentioned before, you must get a 3.x Python Version installed (python --version to check whether a Python V was installed or not)

### Installing Selenium
As I mentioned before, you must get a 3.x Python Version installed (Try python --version to check whether a Python V was installed or not). All the examples are taking into consideration you already have PIP installed (pip --version to check it)

```
pip install selenium
```

## Page Object Model (POM)
This framework was built by using the PO concept which is gonna be useful for interacting an mantaining the coding in a better way. For further reference, please do take a look at the following url > https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/page-objects.html
