# PythonProjects

The intent of this Repository is just to Learn and start creating a Brand New Python Automation Framework with Python. A cool one actually. 
That's it! 

# Set Up
## Python Version
By the time this Framework was created, I started by using the *Python 3.7* Version. However, you might user any 3.x version you'd prefer. I do recomment not to use 2.x versions though.
